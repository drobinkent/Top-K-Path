000100 10 -- 18 decimal all 1 -- latency sensitive short flow

000010 10 -- 10 decimal only 2nd and 3rd bit on -- for high throughput flow. do not interupt two other high prioity flows

000011 10-- 14 decimal all 1 wxcept highest priority  -- query response traffic





# Isolation test :

run typical 3 types of flows and with that start a flow of special type with total volume = capacity of one link * duration.

At the end besides the other 3 types of flow, this special flow should get it's wcplicit bandwidth = one link capacity.

ECMP can not give this.



QoS Pefromance test:

random distribution generation. change the link capacity randdomly.

then say for each tenant link capacity is different. but ecmp can not adopt to thiese things.

so compare hula and p4kp
